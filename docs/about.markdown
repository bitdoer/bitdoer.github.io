Hi. I'm Scott Howard. I'm a mathematician and hobbyist programmer from Tennessee. My current major interest is in Rust, which I've been using for various toy projects like implementing various cryptographic hashes and the like.

I am also a musician---I've played the piano for 17 years, the guitar for about 10 years, and the bass for about 2 years.
